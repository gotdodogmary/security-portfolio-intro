# Security Portfolio Introduction

## About Me
I am a student who is studying cybersecurity with a focus on web security.
I am interested in understanding how vulnerabilities occur and how to prevent them.

## Why Security
Many security incidents happen not because of advanced hacking,
but because of basic design and validation mistakes.
I want to learn how to find these problems and reduce security risks.

## What I Am Learning
- Web architecture (Client-Server, HTTP)
- OWASP Top 10
- SQL Injection, XSS
- Secure authentication design

## Portfolio Plan
This repository will be used as a starting point for my security portfolio.
I will upload analysis reports and security case studies step by step.
